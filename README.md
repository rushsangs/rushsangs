## I am a Computer Scientist.
I graduated with a B.S. in Computer Science from Rutgers University, and a Ph.D. in Human-centered Computing from the University of Utah. My research interests involve using approaches in computing to understand and create narratives. My research projects have focused on computer-assisted authoring and story understanding.

## I am an Educator.
I am an Assistant Teaching Professor at the Khoury College of Computer Science in Northeastern University.

## I am human.
There is a lot more to me than my professional interests, which I usually am happy to talk about in the real world. In the meantime, here's a picture of my favorite pokemon.
